# Google Book Search React App

## Overview

This app is a React-based Google Books Search site. It utilizes React components, helper/util functions, and React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. It also features Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>.
